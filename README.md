# face_detection
## about the project:
The described tool is a real-time face detection hobby tool that utilizes threading for concurrent model training and face detection. The tool performs face detection in real-time by utilizing a non-blocking approach for the detection process. The trained model is stored in a Redis database and updated continuously through concurrent operations. A GoLang upload server has been implemented for adding new faces, and a web page template is available for easy integration of the file uploader API.
